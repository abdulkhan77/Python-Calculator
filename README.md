Python GUI Calculator

A stylish, interactive calculator application built with Python's built-in tkinter library. This project provides a complete, standalone Python script that launches a colorful and fully functional desktop calculator with a dark-themed UI.

Features

Modern UI: A clean, colorful dark-themed design that is easy on the eyes.

Dual Input: Seamlessly use either your mouse (clicking buttons) or your physical keyboard for all inputs.

Standard Operations: Performs all basic arithmetic: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

User-Friendly Symbols: Displays familiar symbols (×, ÷) on buttons while using the correct operators (*, /) for calculation.

Robust Error Handling: Safely handles invalid inputs and mathematical errors (like division by zero) by displaying an "Error" message instead of crashing.

Read-Only Display: The display field is locked to prevent direct text entry, ensuring all input is processed correctly by the application's logic.

How to Run the Script

You do not need to install any third-party libraries to run this script, as it only uses Python's built-in tkinter.

Save the Code: Save the final Python script as gui_calculator_colorful.py.

Run from Terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the file, and execute the following command:

python gui_calculator_colorful.py


The calculator window will immediately open and will be ready to use.

Keyboard Controls

The application is fully controllable from your keyboard:

Numbers (0-9): Press the number keys to add them to the display.

*Operators (+, -, , /): Press the operator keys to add them.

Equals (Enter): Press the Enter key to calculate the result.

Clear (Escape): Press the Escape (Esc) key to clear the entire display.

Backspace: Press the Backspace key to delete the last character.

Dependencies

Python 3.x

Tkinter: This is the standard GUI library for Python and is included by default with most Python installations. No separate installation is required.
